I am a Ph.D. student of FVL Group in the School of Computer Science, Fudan University, advised by Prof. Chen Jingjing and Jiang Yu-gang. I also collaborate with Prof. Wu Zuxuan closely. Before that, I received my B.E. and M.Sc. from Jilin University in July, 2017 and July, 2020. 

I was a visiting student from October, 2018 to June, 2019 in the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. CHUA Tat Seng.

My research interest includes computer vision and AI security. Recently, I am interested in the robustness of video models.
